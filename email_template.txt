 Hi,

I'm a student and recently built a small project in Python that can scrape email IDs of researchers and professors, that's actually how I reached out to you!

You can check out the project here: https://github.com/Siddharthakhandelwal/contact-scraper
Some of my other interesting repos: https://github.com/Siddharthakhandelwal

Also, here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhartha-khandelwal/

I've attached my CV as well, if there's any internship opportunity available this summer, I'd be really grateful to be considered.

Thank you!
